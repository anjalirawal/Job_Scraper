# ðŸ’¼ California Job Scraper

A Python-based web scraper to automatically extract job postings from company career pages located within a 150-mile radius of Los Angeles, CA. The scraper uses both BeautifulSoup (for static pages) and Selenium (for dynamic content), and filters results based on keywords and location-specific city names derived from geographic proximity.
